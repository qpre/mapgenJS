Implementation of the Park Miller (1988) "minimal standard" linear 
 congruential pseudo-random number generator.
 
 For a full explanation visit: http://www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/rand31/
 
 The generator uses a modulus constant (m) of 2^31 - 1 which is a
 Mersenne Prime number and a full-period-multiplier of 16807.
 Output is a 31 bit unsigned integer. The range of values output is
 1 to 2,147,483,646 (2^31-1) and the seed must be in this range too.
 
 David G. Carta's optimisation which needs only 32 bit integer math,
 and no division is actually *slower* in flash (both AS2 & AS3) so
 it's better to use the double-precision floating point version.
